This document contains the following sections:

 * List of tools in the RPTools series
 * Requirements for running the tools
 * Executing the tools
 * Troubleshooting common problems

Documentation for the various tools can be found here at the link below.
However, as the tools develop and change rapidly it's likely that the
forum users will have the scoop on the most current tweaks and features.

Also be sure to watch the screencasts that demonstrate the various
features of MapTool.  One of our forum users put together little
snippets of video that describe various things that new users will need
to know.  They are broken up into topics and organized by GM and Player,
so you only need to view the ones that apply to you.  Visit our main
site and click on the "Tutorials" link in the toolbar.

Welcome to RPTools!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RPTools provides the following programs to enhance your gaming
experience.  All of these are written in Java and are therefore
portable, running on Windows, OS X, and Unix/Linux.

 * DiceTool - Feature-rich dice-rolling application.
 * MapTool - Virtual tabletop application.
 * InitTool - Combat initiative manager
 * TokenTool - Gaming token creation tool.
 * CharTool - Character tracking tool.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			    <<< Requirements >>>

All of the RPTools.net applications are programmed in Java and can be
used on any platform supporting Java 5+.  (CharTool, DiceTool, and
MapTool require Java 6+.)  Specifics of where to find Java for your
platform are provided on the main web site at http://www.rptools.net/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			<<< Starting & Using the Tools >>>

All of the tools can be started using the Java WebStart technology
from the links on the RPTools downloads page at:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=launch

The WebStart technique is completely self-contained.  Full instructions
are given on the page linked above.

Alternatively you can download the zip archive (Windows, OS X, Unix/Linux)
and DMG file (OS X only) from here:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=download

Visit the above link for details on executing the tools; a summary
is provided here.

			<<< ZIP Archive >>>

Extract the zip archive to a folder of your choosing.  Be sure to
extract the directories as well, since MapTool expects to find some of
its code in the "lib" subdirectory.  In the folder where you extract
the archive will be a system-specific start program:

    Windows:	MapToolLauncher.exe
    OS X:	Launch MapTool.command
    Linux/Unix:	Launch MapTool.sh

On all Unix-based systems (OS X, Linux, Unix) you may need to add
execute permission to the file listed above if your zip utility did
not already set that permission for you.  Use your operating system
tools to make this change (Google for "change permissions" if you
need help).

			<<< DMG Disk Image >>>

This file is a disk image that can be installed easily on OS X.  Mac
users may download the file and double-click to begin installation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			<<< Troubleshooting >>>
		<<< Troubleshooting Download Version >>>

PROGRAM FAILS TO START:  If your system-specific file (above) fails
to start the application, verify that you have a Java Runtime
Environment installed.  From a command prompt, type "java -version"
(without the quotes) and press <Enter>. The Java version should be
printed to the command prompt.  If you receive an error message,
download and install the appropriate Java package for your operating
system as described at the above URLs.

MAP DOESN'T LOAD [MapTool only]:  Some larger maps may require more
memory to initially load than the default Java Runtime Environment
allocates.  Check the folder where you extracted the zip archive.
As described above, each operating system has its own start file.
For Windows, the EXE will ask for memory size parameters -- try
increasing the maximum memory and running MapTool again.  For OS X
and Linux/Unix users, edit the corresponding script and modify the
memory settings at the top of the file.

Mac Users:  If you installed from the DMG file, look inside the
resulting app package for a file named "Info.plist" and edit it with a
text editor.  It contains the memory settings.

			<<< Troubleshooting >>>
		<<< Troubleshooting WebStart Version >>>

The WebStart feature will download the appropriate files from the
RPTools web site and save them on your computer before executing
the program.  You will be prompted to allow this to happen.  Once
complete, the program will begin execution (you may be prompted for
this to be allowed as well).  If you right-click on the WebStart
link and save the downloaded WebStart file on your desktop, you can
double-click it at any time in the future to execute the program
from the copy saved on your system -- you won't need an Internet
connection in the future.  (In fact, you can send the JNLP file to
other players and they can double-click it as well!  Just remember
that the very first time you run a particular version, you need an
Internet connection in order to download the files for that version.)

		<<< Troubleshooting Other Problems >>>

MAPTOOL NETWORKING PROBLEM:  Networking is a big topic, so please
visit our forum (link below) and check out the Networking FAQ in
the MapTool -> HowTo subforum.  There you will find a document that
describes what MapTool needs in order to work properly along with
a step-by-step approach for diagnosing your networking problems.
Solutions for common problems is included in the NFAQ.

MapTool creates a log of errors in the ".maptool" folder under your
home directory.  Also in there will be a bunch of subfolders that
are used by MapTool internally to keep track of maps and other
images.  If your problem is repeatable, i.e. can be reproduced over
and over again, please remove the existing log file and then reproduce
the error.  Then zip up the log file and attach it to a post in the
MapTool forum.

For any other issues, please come to http://forums.RPTools.net/ and
check the forums.  In particular, use the error message as a search
string to see if your question has been asked and answered previously.
If not, post a message there describing the difficulties you are having.
Most problems can be addressed quickly by one of the many helpful
forum members or one of our team members.
