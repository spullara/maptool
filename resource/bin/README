RPTools provides the following programs to enhance your gaming experience.

 * DiceTool - Feature-rich dice-rolling application.
 * MapTool - Virtual tabletop application.
 * InitTool - Combat initiative manager
 * TokenTool - Gaming token creation tool.
 * CharTool - Character tracking tool.

			    <<< Requirements >>>

All of the RPTools.net applications are programmed in Java and can be
used on any platform supporting Java 5+.  (DiceTool and CharTool require
Java 6.)

The Java Runtime Environment is required and can be downloaded from
the Sun website:

   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

			<<< Starting & Using the Tools >>>

All of the tools can be started using the Java WebStart technology
from the links on the RPTools downloads page at:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=launch

The WebStart technique is completely self-contained.  Full instructions
are given on the page linked to above.

Alternatively you can download the Zip Archive from here:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=download

Extract the Zip Archive to a folder of your choosing.  In the folder
where you extract the archive will be a system-specific start program:

    Windows:	MapToolLauncher.exe
    OS X:	Launch MapTool.command
    Linux/Unix:	Launch MapTool.sh

On all Unix-based systems (OS X, Linux, Unix) you will need to add
execute permission to the file listed above for your system.  Use
your operating system tools to make this change (Google for "change
permissions" if you need help).

Program fails to start -- If your system-specific file (above) fails
to start the application, verify that you have a Java Runtime
Environment installed.  From a command prompt, type "java -version"
and hit <Enter>. The Java version should be printed to the command
prompt.  If you receive an error message, download and install the
appropriate Java package for your operatin system at the URL noted
above.

Map takes forever to load (or never loads) [MapTool only] -- Some larger
maps may require more memory to initially load than the default
Java Runtime Environment allocates.  Check the folder where you
extracted the zip archive.  As described above, each operating system
has its own start file.  For Windows, the EXE will ask for memory size
parameters -- try increasing the maximum memory and running MapTool
again.  For OSX and Linux/Unix users, edit the corresponding script and
modify the memory settings at the top of the file.

			<<< Troubleshooting >>>
		<<< Troubleshooting WebStart Version >>>

The WebStart feature will download the appropriate files from the
RPTools web site and save them on your computer before executing the
program.  You will be prompted to allow this to happen.  Once complete,
the program will begin execution (you may be prompted for this to be
allowed as well).  If you right-click on the WebStart link and save the
downloaded WebStart file on your desktop, you can double-click it at any
time in the future to execute the program from the copy saved on your
system -- you won't need an Internet connection in the future.  (In
fact, you can send the JNLP file to other players and they can
double-click it as well!  Just remember that the very first time you run
a particular version, you need an Internet connection in order to
download the files.)

MapTool fails to connect to a server, or others cannot connect to your
server -- Networking is a big topic, so please visit our forums (link
below) and check out the Networking FAQ in the MapTool -> HOWTO
subforum.  There you will find a document that describes what MapTool
needs in order to work properly along with a step-by-step approach for
diagnosing your networking problems with solutions for common ones.

MapTool creates a log of errors in the ".maptool" folder under your home
directory.  Also in there will be a bunch of subfolders that are used by
MapTool internally to keep track of maps and other images.  If your
problem is repeatable, i.e. can be reproduced over and over again,
please remove the existing log file and then reproduce the error.  Then
ZIP the log file and attach it to a post on the forums (link below).

For any other issues, please come to http://forums.RPTools.net/ and
post a message there describing the difficulties you are having.
Most problems can be addressed quickly by one of the many helpful
forum members or one of our team members.
